## Definitions

### Lexicographically Smaller

A string `a` is **lexicographically smaller** than a string `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.

If the first `min(a.length, b.length)` characters do not differ, then the shorter string is the lexicographically smaller one.

### Height-Balanced

A **height-balanced** binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

## Interesting Knowledge

### Greatest Common Divisor of Strings

- If s1 + s2 = s2 + s1, there exists a substring `x` in both s1 and s2 where `x` divides `s1` and `s2`
- A string `x` divides `y` if and only if `y = x + ... + x`

## Algorithms to Remember
